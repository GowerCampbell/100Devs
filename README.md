## üß≠ Core Philosophy: Learning How to Learn

The most critical skill in tech is learning how to learn effectively. My approach is grounded in proven cognitive science techniques to ensure I'm not just memorizing, but truly understanding the material.

- **Core Training:** **[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)** on Coursera forms the foundation of my study habits.

### My Study Method
To treat this bootcamp like a final exam every single day, I use the following methods:

- **üß† Active Recall & Revision:** Applying evidence-based revision strategies. **[Watch: Revision Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE)**
- **üóìÔ∏è Spaced Repetition:** Using tools like **[AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/about)** for flashcards to commit key concepts to long-term memory. **[Watch: The Power of Spaced Repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM)**
